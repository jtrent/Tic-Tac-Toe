README -- Tic Tac Toe
================

This Tic Tac Toe game is designed to measure how well children play with each 
other.  As children take their turns, they are given a choice to switch to 
the next player, or to continue selecting squares.  When a child makes a move, 
a log file is updated that details what move they have made and if they are 
moving out of turn or not.  The log is also noted when a player wins, and if
there is a draw.

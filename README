README -- Tic Tac Toe
================

This Tic Tac Toe game is designed to measure how well children play with each 
other.  As children take their turns, they are given a choice to switch to 
the next player, or to continue selecting squares.  When a child makes a move, 
a log file is updated that details what move they have made and if they are 
moving out of turn or not.  The log is also noted when a player wins, and if
there is a draw.

* A note on the code *
Because I couldn't get the buttons to display images programmatically,
I had to find a way around that.  I even tried compiling classmates 
programs that did work, and the images would not display right.  Since
I am developing this program on a Mac for another system, I had to find
another way to develop it in a way that I knew would work on both systems.
My workaround was to use a button per state, per square.  This way I could
use Qt Creator to manually put the images on the buttons.  Then the 
buttons were hidden depending on who's square it was, who's turn it was,
and so on.  It is not the most efficient way to do this and resulted in
me not being able to use arrays of buttons and other conventions that
would have made the code look better.

INSTALL
-------

To install on a linux computer, cd to ttt/.  Run qmake-qt4 ttt.pro, then qmake to 
generate the makefile.  Then run make to compile the program to produce the
"ttt" executable.

USAGE
-----

Run the executable.  The game starts with a blank board and player X is the 
first player to play.  The player presses the next button to switch to the next
player, player O.  The players continue to mark their squares until a player 
wins, or the there is a draw.  The players are prompted that someone won, or
that there was a draw, and clicking anywhere on the screen will begin a new 
game.

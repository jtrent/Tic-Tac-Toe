Some of the conventions in Wildfire were not followed because of the 
fact that a lot of the content was automatically generated by Qt 
Creator and quake.  These were primarily naming differences, which
I followed to make the code more uniform.

Instead of variable and method names using the lower case convention,
the lower camel one was used.

Instead of naming files with the .cc or .hh extensions, Qt Creator uses .cpp and .h.
